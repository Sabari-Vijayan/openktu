# OpenKTU

**OpenKTU** is a free and open platform created to support engineering students under KTU with reliable learning resources — **no ads, no payments, no distractions**.

We aim to build a **minimalist, fast, and clean** website because everyone is tired of clicking sketchy link-embedded PDFs that open random new tabs and sometimes contain incorrect notes. Students deserve better.

## Why OpenKTU?

- No ads  
- No paywalls  
- No login/signup  
- No data collection  
- No unnecessary backend  

Everything is static and openly accessible because education shouldn’t require trade-offs like giving away your data or dealing with unsafe links.

There are powerful free tools and services available today — not using them for the benefit of the student community would be foolish. OpenKTU simply leverages these tools to deliver accurate notes quickly and safely.

## Future Plans

We might add lightweight systems to prevent bot abuse or spam, but **your privacy will always remain untouched**.

## Join the Movement

Contribute notes, corrections, or improvements.  
Help build a platform where knowledge is truly open, accessible, and trustworthy.

**Knowledge should be free, open, and accessible to everyone.**
