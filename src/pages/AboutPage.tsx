      <h2>OpenKTU — Free Educational Resources for KTU Students</h2>

      <h4>This site was created to provide educational resources to KTU students — openly, freely, and
      without paywalls or ads. There are enough generous people and free resources in the world that
      charging for something as essential as education shouldn’t be the norm.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <h4>To make high-quality academic notes and learning materials available to every KTU student,
      regardless of ability to pay. We believe knowledge should be free to use, reuse, and redistribute
      — without legal, social, or technological restrictions.
      </h4>

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>

      <h4>Open knowledge is knowledge that’s free to use, reuse, and redistribute without legal, social,
      or technological restriction. Here you can share what you know without unnecessary limits — because
      education is a right, not a commodity.
